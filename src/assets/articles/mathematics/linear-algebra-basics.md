# Introduction to Linear Algebra

## Vector Spaces and Linear Transformations

Linear algebra is fundamental to many areas of mathematics and its applications. In this article, we'll explore the basic concepts of vector spaces and linear transformations.

### Vector Spaces

A vector space is a collection of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars. The most familiar example is R³, the three-dimensional real coordinate space.

Key properties include:
- Closure under addition and scalar multiplication
- Associativity and commutativity of addition
- Existence of zero vector
- Existence of additive inverses

### Linear Transformations

A linear transformation T: V → W between vector spaces satisfies:
1. T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)
2. T(cv) = cT(v)

Examples include:
- Rotation matrices
- Projection operators
- Scaling transformations

## Applications

Linear algebra has numerous applications in:
- Computer graphics
- Quantum mechanics
- Data analysis
- Machine learning
