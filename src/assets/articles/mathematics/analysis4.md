空间的基本概念与关系

度量空间

首先我们先定义metric spaces(1.d(x,y)>=0 and d(x,y)=0 if and only if x=y 2.d(x,y)=d(y,x) 3.d(x,y)<=d(x,z)+d(z,y)，X是一个set，d是一个X*X->R的一个metric or distance function)

赋范空间

然后我们再定义normed vector space（因为我们可以build metric spaces from other types of spaces called normed spaces）(every noromed vector space induces a metric space with the metric d(x,y)=||x-y||))（p-norm，以及a discrete metric space can never be generated by a norm(norm有一个scale factor的性质就是你的距离理论上来讲可以被任意的scaler给scale)）(每一个norm有一个induced的metric space)

内积空间

normed vector spaces themselves sometimes arise from an inner product space(然后定义一个inner product space)---> Cauchy-Schwarz inequality-->every inner product space is a normed space with the norm ||x||=sqrt(<x,x>), and hence a metric space

度量空间性质

现在定义了metric space可以看看metric space的一些性质

收敛性

convergence（in metric space感觉是序列的convergenve能不能converge到这个metric space ）--> Let(X,d) be a metric space, and(x_n) a sequence of points of X, If(x_n) converges, then its limit is unique

开集和闭集

open and closed sets(open ball and closed ball无限个开集的交集不一定是开集，但并集一定是一个开集，无限个闭集的并集不一定是闭集，但无限个闭集的交集一定是闭集，可以理解为对于开集，我可以一直取更小的集合，那么我这个交集就变成一个点，对于闭集，我可以固定一边，另一边一直趋向于一个值但是取不到)

定义：(X,d) be a metric space, and let A be a subset of X. A point x belongs to X is said to be a limit point of the set A if for every r>0, the open ball centered at x, radius r contains some y belongs to A y!=x(也就是我无论取多么小的圈我都找得到一些点，那么这个点就是limit points)

有一个lemma就是证明limit point也可以说 there exists some sequence y_n of points of A such that y_n!=x for all n belongs N, y_n belongs A for all n belongs to N and y_n->x

Let (X,d) be a metric space, and let A belongs to X, Then:
1.A is closed if and only if A contains all its limit points.
2.A is closed if and only if any convergent sequence of points of A converges to a point of A

The closure of a set A is the union of A and the set of its limit points. We denote it by $\bar{A}$,then we define a set A is closed if and only if A=$\bar{A}$(这个就相当于我的一个集合已经包含我的极限点那么就肯定是一个闭集)

完备性

Completeness(The concept of Cauchy sequences that we had in R carries over to metric spaces and is a very important concept)(in discrete metric spaces, sequences are cauchy if and only if they are eventually constant), if (x_n) converges, then it is cauchy the converse may not be true so we introduce complete metric space-->a metric space such that every cauchy sequence in that space converges is called a complete metric space. A complete normed space is called a banach space.(这个地方的重点是我先有一个cauchy sequence，满足柯西就是说我们找的到一个N，当我们大于这个值的时候，我们能小于一个 $\epsilon$ 但这里的关键是我们只能取discrete，那么我一定后面取的点一定先满足柯西 并且能够converge )

完备度量空间

If(X,d) is a complete metric space and Y belongs to X is closed, then (Y,d) is complete(这个就是证明我们的极限值首先在X里面，然后我们因为y是closed的那么(Y,d) is complete)

度量空间的完备扩展

现在我们开始考虑说如果an metric space which is not complete, can we somehow find a larger complete metric space which contains that space（就是包含所有极限点）A metric space (X,d) such that every Cauchy sequence in that space converges is called a complete metric space. A complete normed space is called a banach space

稠密性

Dense means that the subset D is everywhere is X in the sense that for any point in X we can find points in D as cloase as we want to that point(for every point x and every $\epsilon$ there exists a point d belongs to D such that d(x,d)< $\epsilon$)

有界性

A metric space M is bounded if there is a constant D such that d(p,q)<=D for all p,q belongs to M

紧致性

用开覆盖来定义紧致性，比用closed and bounded来定义紧致集更为合适，紧致集捕捉到了收敛子序列的更必要的条件，捕捉到了一个有限性，

对于离散度量空间，有限集时紧致的，但是无限集不是紧致的

If S is compact,then S is closed and bounded
prove it is closed, we need to prove that it contains all its limit point, which is equivalent to proving that any point not in S is not a limit of point of S,we use the idea that construct closed ball around the point that is not in S, and we create finite subcover to cover S then we can find a bigger cover such that we can cover S,then the complement which is an open ball ,when it intersects S we will get empty set,clearly it will not be a limit point of S

next we prove the bounded 其实就是构造一种cover，然后我们知道S一定可以被finite subcover给覆盖那么cover是bounded


A closed subset of a compact set is compact
