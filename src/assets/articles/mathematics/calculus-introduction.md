# Fundamentals of Calculus

## The Concept of Limits

Calculus begins with the fundamental concept of limits. Understanding limits is crucial for grasping both differentiation and integration.

### Definition of a Limit

For a function f(x), we say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L if:
For every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that |f(x) - L| < ε whenever 0 < |x - a| < δ

### Examples

1. lim(x→0) sin(x)/x = 1
2. lim(x→∞) (1 + 1/x)^x = e

## Derivatives

The derivative represents the rate of change of a function at any point.

Key concepts:
- Instantaneous rate of change
- Slope of tangent line
- Applications in optimization

### Common Derivatives
- d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
- d/dx(sin x) = cos x
- d/dx(e^x) = e^x
