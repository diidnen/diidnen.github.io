# This file will store some of my experiences in algorithms and data structures

1. Sometimes using double pointers is better than using double for loops

2. Sometimes different expressions (ideas) can make the code different (specifically, this means achieving the same functionality but with different approaches)

3. When it comes to traversal, we should always consider these questions: How to traverse? This can be broken down into:

- What is the starting point?
- What is the traversal method?
- What are the traversal conditions?

For the starting point, we can consider various approaches: left to right, right to left, top to bottom, bottom to top, outside to inside, inside to outside, etc.
Don't limit your thinking, be bold and try different approaches.
