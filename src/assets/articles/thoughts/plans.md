After completing my undergraduate studies, I plan to pursue a graduate degree. My primary goal is to enter academia, with the tech industry as a backup option. I am particularly interested in applied mathematics because of its strong connection to solving real-world problems, such as modeling social phenomena, artificial intelligence, and stock market trends. At the same time, I deeply appreciate the beauty of pure mathematics, but I feel that working on it for many years might become somewhat monotonous for me.

While I have not yet decided on a specific focus, I am currently drawn to areas such as data science, modeling, and evaluating different approaches. At CUHK, I find the Computational Mathematics program particularly appealing, especially its research in Numerical Analysis, Image Processing, and Optimization. I am also very interested in topics such as solving non-convex optimization problems, big data processing in data science, and machine learning.



I am applying for SURP for several reasons:
I want to explore how the mathematical concepts I learn in class and the programming skills I acquire outside of class can be applied to real-life problems.
The Chinese University of Hong Kong provides an excellent platform for collaborating with top-tier professors and meeting like-minded peers, which will help to come up with new ideas.
I have a strong interest in understanding how mathematics is applied to real-world problems. In my spare time, I taught myself programming and AI and participated in Kaggle competitions with friends. These experiences deepened my curiosity about the applications of mathematics. SURP’s focus on practical projects aligns perfectly with my interests.
I also read that Denver Correia highlighted the excellent support provided by SURP, which makes me excited about the opportunity to collaborate with professors 
I am interested in "Data-Driven Methods for Scientific Computing" project as in one of my courses on fluid mechanics, I noticed many theoretical assumptions, and I felt they might not hold true in real-world scenarios. During a conversation with a professor, I was introduced to computational methods and their applications in approximating real-life problems through numerical approaches. This sparked my interest in understanding how we can improve such methods and what challenges we might face, as well as the role of mathematics in these processes.

I am also interested in the other two projects. In my spare time, I studied stochastic calculus and realized that when dealing with more random functions, we can approach their properties through probability, which deeply impressed me. As for the social network analysis project, I found the randomness intriguing and began considering which methods to apply, how to evaluate each approach’s strengths and weaknesses, and how to draw conclusions. Is it about using specific tests to decide? Or perhaps creating unique tests? Lastly, I am also very interested in machine learning. how networ

I am applying for the STOR-i Summer Research Programme because I am passionate about using mathematical modeling and computational methods to solve real-world problems. My academic background and personal experiences make me curious about how mathematical theory and programming skills can be applied to practical challenges, and STOR-i provides an ideal platform to develop this interest further.

The first thing I want to illustrate is about my passion into the research. Mathematics, for me, is not just about abstract theories(Although I really appreciate the trend or pattern under pure math objects); it also has strong power lying in its ability to model and solve complex real-life problems.One of my most memorable academic experiences was studying fluid mechanics, where I noticed that many theoretical models rely on strong assumptions that may not always hold in reality. And a discussion with professor make me more curious about computational methods(algorithms) using programming for approximating real-world problems through numerical technique. Beyond my academic curriculum, I have independently studied programming and artificial intelligence, applying these skills to a Kaggle competition about how to deal with time series problem with friends.
and the idea of revealing true compents out of loads of factors using matrix is really fancinating(pca)
The opportunity to work under the supervision of a PhD researcher excites me, as I want to gain insight into high-level academic research. I find STOR-i’s focus on practical, real-world applications and it really aligns with my long-term career plan. Whether it is modeling social networks, or analyzing financial trends, I am highly motivated to explore how mathematical methods can be used to solve pressing challenges.

I believe my solid foundation in pure math and problem-solving mindset, ability to think outside the box, and strong communication skills make me a suitable candidate for this programme. I enjoy collaborating with others to tackle challenges and am eager to engage with like-minded peers in STOR-i’s dynamic research environment.
