# Basically, I am a person who likes to think a lot about things, and I like to write down my thoughts, so I will keep updating this article.

Recently, sometimes I feel that social media generates a lot of pressure and anxiety. I just keep refreshing the page and cannot stop myself from doing that. I think it is because I try to escape from my worries, but in fact, I just turn my anxiety into another form that may come from comparing myself with others. I should be confident; even though there may be a lot of people around me who are better than me, and I am always trying to be better, just do what I can do and be happy with it. I should be myself and be confident with who I am. And if I do not want to refresh the page again, I should tell myself just not to use it - it is a waste of time. I can do other things that may benefit society and myself. 11/09/2024
